## Thrive or Wither: Exploring the Impacts of Multi-Year Droughts on Vegetation

### Abstract

Multi-year droughts (MYDs) have devastating effects on vegetation. Due to climate change, MYDs may become more frequent and intense, making it crucial to accurately assess their impact on vegetation. In this study, we used ERA5 meteorological reanalysis and MODIS remote-sensing data to evaluate vegetation drought sensitivity and investigate the effects of MYDs on seven types of vegetation in six regions worldwide, comparing these impacts to those of normal droughts (NDs). We found that croplands, urban areas, and shrublands are highly sensitive to drought, while grasslands and trees are less so. As anticipated, the overall impact of MYDs on vegetation was negative, but our findings revealed significant spatial and temporal variations with areas showing significant greening during MYDs. In general, shrublands experienced the largest decrease in greenness, while trees flourished. Aridity of the area is the primary factor influencing vegetation response to MYDs. Vegetation in water-limited areas tends to suffer during MYDs, whereas vegetation in energy-limited areas thrives as long as sufficient water is available. When compared to the impact of NDs on vegetation, MYDs generally have a more negative impact. Overall, these findings show there is no unidirectional response of vegetation to MYDs and that local factors, like natural energy and water availability, play a vital role in quantifying the complex interplay between drought and vegetation drought impacts.  

### Plain Language Summary
Multi-year droughts (droughts that last more than a year, MYDs) can severely harm vegetation, and their frequency and intensity may increase due to climate change. It is essential to understand how MYDs affect vegetation to manage their impacts better. In this study, we used meteorological data from ERA5 and satellite data from MODIS to assess vegetation sensitivity to drought across seven types of vegetation in six regions globally. We compared the effects of MYDs with those of normal droughts (NDs). Our results show that croplands, urban areas, and shrublands are highly sensitive to drought, while grasslands and trees are less affected. As can be expected, MYDs have a negative effect on vegetation in general, but we also found large areas where MYDs cause vegetation to become greener. Shrublands showed the largest decrease in greenness, whereas trees often thrived. We found that this difference depends on the type of vegetation and the energy and water availability in the region. Compared to NDs, MYDs typically have a more negative impact on vegetation. Our findings highlight that vegetation response to MYDs is complex and depends on local factors such as energy and water availability.
